# A Julia implementation of the HEAAN scheme

This is an implementation of:

J. H. Cheon, A. Kim, M. Kim, and Y. Song, *"Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers,"* [Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 10624 LNCS, pp. 409â€“437 (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70694-8_15),

and partially

J. H. Cheon, K. Han, A. Kim, M. Kim, and Y. Song, *"Improved Bootstrapping for Approximate Homomorphic Encryption,"* [eprint 2018/1043](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1043).

For the further development of this scheme one can refer to

J. H. Cheon, K. Han, A. Kim, M. Kim, and Y. Song, *"A Full RNS Variant of Approximate Homomorphic Encryption,"* [eprint 2018/931](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/931.pdf).

The implementation is based on the [reference C++ code](https://github.com/snucrypto/HEAAN).
